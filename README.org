This package provides Org dynamic blocks for metadata of volumes of
medium such as books.

It retrieves information from web sites and APIs and insert it into
a block in Org. It builds a search query from the current Org
entry.

It also provides a command for updating the current Org entry from
the retrieved information. For example, it can update the heading
to match the accurate title of the volume, add a tag to denote the
format, and set entry properties which will be convenient for
scripting.

Out of the box it supports retrieving information of books using
Google Books API v1.

It is designed to be extensible, so you can add custom media types
and metadata providers. For example, it would be possible to add
providers for video, music, etc.

** Usage

:CREATED_TIME: [2021-02-14 Sun 14:08]
:END:
At present, =org-volume= package only provides a built-in support for Google Books API v1.
You can add other providers by adding entries to =org-volume-site-alist= variable.

**** Retrieving metadata for the heading
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2021-02-14 Sun 14:09]
:END:
To insert the metadata of a title, create a =volume= dynamic block:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin: volume
  ,#+end:
#+end_src

If you run =C-c C-c= on the block, it retrieves information from the default site, i.e. Google Books, and insert a list into the block.
**** Updating the Org entry
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2021-02-14 Sun 14:12]
:END:
Once you generate the =volume= block, you can update the Org entry from the metadata.

If you run =org-volume-update-entry-from-dblock= on the block, the entry is updated as follows:

1. The heading is updated to the title + subtitle (if any).
2. =book= tag is added to the headline.
3. Some properties, e.g. the ISBN code of the book, are added.
4. It inserts a thumbnail before the dynamic block.
**** Inserting the table of contents of the book
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2021-02-14 Sun 14:15]
:END:
After you update the Org entry, you can optionally add the table of contents (TOC) of the book
if it is published from one of the supported publishers.
At present, only [[https://pragprog.com/][Pragmatic Bookshelf]] is supported.

To insert a TOC, create a =volume-toc= dynamic block in the same entry as the =volume= block:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin: volume-toc
  ,#+end:
#+end_src

It must reside under the same Org headline, and it doesn't work inside subtrees.

When you run =C-c C-c= on the dynamic block, it finds a web page for the title on the publisher's web site, scrape the web page, and extract and insert the TOC into the block.

You can add support for more publishers by extending =org-volume-publisher-site-list=.
Some publishers may prevent bots from accessing their web sites, so you cannot retrieve TOCs of books from those publishers.

When you scrape data from websites, make sure that you remain a good developer:

- Check Terms of Use of the web site you are trying to scrape.
- Stick with common practices of ethical web scraping.
